domain#Category-AIHarms,AIHarms,Threats related to AI harms.
domain#Category-Anomalies,Modelling Error,"Category for modelling error threats, corresponding to the domain#Anomalies compliance set."
domain#Category-ArtificialModelConstructs,Artificial Model Constructs,The threat provides a logical connection in a threat path representing some modelling equivalence relationship that is needed to map threat causes or effects to user-visible assets.
domain#Category-AssetUsage,Asset Usage,"Threats that model the involvement of assets in the system. These are treated as threats because (a) being involved means an asset could be attacked or exploited, and (b) it means we can model policies to restrict involvement as control strategies."
domain#Category-ComplianceThreats,Compliance Threat,"Threats that represent potential non-compliance of regulations, standards or best practices."
domain#Category-DenialOfServiceAttacks,Denial Of Service Attacks,Attacks intended to deny access to assets.
domain#Category-DiscoveryOfVulnerabilies,Discovery Of Vulnerability,Discovery by or disclosure to potential attackers of a software vulnerability.
domain#Category-ExploitationOfImposterPrivileges,Exploitation Of Imposter Privileges,"Actions that are authorised, but could be abused by an attacker who succeeds in impersonating a holder of the necessary privileges."
domain#Category-ExploitationOfPrivileges,Exploitation Of Privileges,"Actions that are authorised, but could be abused by an attacker who succeeds in acquiring the necessary privileges."
domain#Category-ExploitationOfVulnerabilities,Exploitation Of Vulnerability,Attacks that involve accessing bugs in software that allow unauthorised use of privileges.
domain#Category-ExploitationOfVulnerabilityEffects,Exploitation Of Vulnerability Effects,Use of unauthorised use of privileges obtained by access to software vulnerabilities.
domain#Category-InsiderAttacks,Insider Attack,"Attacks by stakeholders with legitimate system roles, caused by a lack of intrinsic trustworthiness."
domain#Category-MaliciousEmail,Malicious Email,Attacks in which email provides the means to inject malicious content into the target socio-technical system.
domain#Category-MaliciousInput,Malicious Input,Attack carried out by arranging for unauthentic input to be used by a process.
domain#Category-MalwareAttack,MalwareAttack,An attack carried out autonomously by malware.
domain#Category-NormalOperation,NormalOperation,"Normal operational processes, e.g. starting services, enabling communications, etc. The effect is typically to bring an asset or function into service. While this is usually desirable, it does expose the asset to threats, and in some cases the best defence is to disable the asset or function. For this reason, such processes are treated as threats and disablement measures as control strategies against those threats."
domain#Category-PhysicalAttacks,Physical Attack,Attacks that involve physical intrusion to restricted areas or physical access to devices or networks.
domain#Category-RemoteAttacks,Remote Attack,Unauthorised remote access exploiting lack of controls not software vulnerabilities.
domain#Category-SecondaryThreats,Secondary Threat,Threats representing mechanisms by which adverse effects can propagate within an asset or between dependent assets.
domain#Category-SideEffectsOfSecurity,Side Effects Of Security,Threats caused or enabled by the presence of security measures.
domain#Category-SnoopingAttacks,Snooping Attack,Attacks involving interception of communication at various points in a network.
domain#Category-SoftwareBugs,Software Bug,Software bugs that are not vulnerabilities but internal errors that cause problems without being exploited by an attacker.
domain#Category-SpoofingAttacks,Spoofing Attack,Attacks involving interception of communicating entities at various points in a network.
domain#Category-SystemDeficiencies,System Deficiency,"The system model may be self-consistent and formally correct, but it represents a system in which some of the functionality cannot work as specified."
