Note:
Icons should not use domain-specific names, e.g. "Process", instead they should use visually descriptive names such as "cog".
These can then be mapped to various domain models using the ontologies.json file.
It keeps the system modeller clean of domain-specific "pollution" and helps to re-use icons across domains.
